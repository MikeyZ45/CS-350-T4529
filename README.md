# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - the final project was to be able to use the different drivers taught through the semester and making them all work together to enable the led's and buttons and temperature sensor. This would allow the user to take readings and handle tasks with those readings.
# What did you do particularly well?
  - I was able to clean up my code and make it all read by the system and I was bale to get the inital projects finished but the final one I was not so lucky. I got behiond since the board I had purchased was faulty and I wasnt sure of this until around week 4.
# Where could you improve?
  - if i didnt get sent a bad board I would have had more time to be able to get the code finished. The way I had to work was stressful and I really didnt have a good time especially spending extra money because the first board came broken.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - I am now able to write code that communites with a microprocessor. being able to setup this type of code is very import and useful in many applications.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - The skills learned in this project are many. Time management, layout, diagrams, a lot fo this project can be carried over to other projects later on down the road.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - To keep this project readable and undertsandable there is some commenting and clean spacing syntax that was kept up with. This project was interesting and I am going to keep working on it to better my own skills.
