 1. After working through this process, you will need to address the following questions:
• What does pwmled2 set the PWM period to?
	- Task periodically increments the PWM duty for the on board LED.

• Which PWM_xxx() function sets the PWM period?
	- PWM_setPeriod and PWM_setDutyAndPeriod

• Which PWM_xxx() function sets the PWM duty cycle?
	- PWM_setDuty and PWM_setDutyAndPeriod

• What is the purpose of the while(1) loop in pwmled2?
	- this creates an infinite loop so it will only be escaped manually.

• What is the purpose of usleep() in the while(1) loop?
	- this pauses the program for a set amount of time to allow processing to happen before starting the loop over.


2. Now it is time to modify pwmled2. Your code will need to accomplish the following:
• Set duty for PWM1 to 90%.
• Set duty for PWM2 to 10%.
• Set the sleep(1) function so it sleeps for 1 second.
• Set duty for PWM1 to 0%.
• Set duty for PWM2 to 90%.
• Create your code in a loop. 

while(1){
  	PWM_setDuty(pwm1, 229);

        PWM_setDuty(pwm2, 25);

        sleep(1);

        PWM_setDuty(pwm1, 0);

        PWM_setDuty(pwm2, 229);
};
